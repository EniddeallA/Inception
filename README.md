# Inception

My version of the Inception project at 42 school that aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker.
You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual machine.

This project has been successfully done with all mandatory tasks.

Feel free to use it to undestand the project, never use it for cheating!
